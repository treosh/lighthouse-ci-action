## Examples

**Basic example**: run Lighthouse on each push to the repo and save results as action artifacts.

Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the list of URLs to audit using Lighthouse.
The results will be stored as a build artifact:

```yml
name: Lighthouse
on: push
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Audit URLs using Lighthouse
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
        with:
          urls: |
            https://example.com/
            https://example.com/blog
      - name: Save results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: lighthouse-results
          path: '.lighthouseci' # This will save the Lighthouse results as .json files
```

[‚öôÔ∏è See this workflow in use](https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action/actions?workflow=LHCI-hermetic)

**Advanced example**: run Lighthouse audit for each unique deployment, test performance budgets, and save results to the [public storage](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/cli.md#upload) for a quick debugging.

URLs support interpolation of process env vars so that you can write URLs like:

```yml
- name: Run Lighthouse and test budgets
  uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
  with:
    urls: |
      https://pr-$PR_NUMBER.staging-example.com/
      https://pr-$PR_NUMBER.staging-example.com/blog
    budgetPath: ./budgets.json
    temporaryPublicStorage: true
    env:
      PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

[‚öôÔ∏è See this workflow in use](https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action/actions?workflow=LHCI-multiple-urls)

> **Note**: to view the reports download the JSON files from the artifacts and open them with the [Lighthouse Viewer App](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/) or follow the `temporary-public-storage` link printed in the action.

## Inputs

#### `urls` (required)

Provide the list of URLs separated by a new line.
Each URL is audited using the latest version of Lighthouse and Chrome preinstalled on the environment.

```yml
urls: |
  https://example.com/
  https://example.com/blog
  https://example.com/pricing
```

#### `temporaryPublicStorage` (default: false)

All results are private by default. Use this option to upload reports to LHCI's `temporary-public-storage`. You can find out more about `temporary-public-storage` in the [LHCI repo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/cli.md#upload).

```yml
temporaryPublicStorage: true
```

#### `runs` (default: 1)

Specify the number of runs to do on each URL.

> **Note**: Asserting against a single run can lead to flaky performance assertions.
> Use `1` only to ensure static audits like Lighthouse scores or page size.

```yml
runs: 3
```

#### `budgetPath`

Use a performance budget to keep your page size in check. `Lighthouse CI Action` will fail the build if one of the URLs exceeds the budget.

Learn more about the [budget.json spec](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/budget.json) and [practical use of performance budgets](https://web.dev/use-lighthouse-for-performance-budgets).

```yml
budgetPath: ./budget.json
```

#### `configPath`

Set a path to a custom [lighthouserc file](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/cli.md#configuration) for full control of the Lighthouse environment and assertions.

Use `lighthouserc` to configure the collection of data (via Lighthouse config and Chrome Flags), and CI assertions (via LHCI assertions).

```yml
configPath: ./lighthouserc.json
```

#### `upload`

Upload Lighthouse results to a private [LHCI server](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) by specifying both `upload.serverBaseUrl` and `upload.token`.
This will replace uploading to `temporary-public-storage`.

> **Note**: Use [Github secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) to keep your server address hidden!

```yml
upload.serverBaseUrl: ${{ secrets.LHCI_SERVER }}
upload.token: ${{ secrets.LHCI_TOKEN }}
```

Specify an API token for the LHCI server. [Learn how to generate a token](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#historical-reports--diffing-lighthouse-ci-server).

## Recipes

<details>
 <summary>Run Lighthouse and validate against a performance budget.</summary><br>

Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the list of URLs to audit
and identify a budget with `budgetPath`.

#### main.yml

```yml
name: Lighthouse
on: push
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Run Lighthouse on urls and validate with budgets.json
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
        with:
          urls: 'https://example.com/'
          budgetPath: './budgets.json'
```

Make a `budget.json` file with [budgets syntax](https://web.dev/use-lighthouse-for-performance-budgets/).

> **Note**: Under the hood, this will be transformed into LHCI assertions.

#### budgets.json

```json
[
  {
    "path": "/*",
    "resourceSizes": [
      {
        "resourceType": "document",
        "budget": 18
      },
      {
        "resourceType": "total",
        "budget": 200
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

 <summary>Audit with custom Chrome options and custom Lighthouse config.</summary><br>

Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the list of URLs to audit and
identify a `lighthouserc` file with `configPath`.

#### main.yml

```yml
name: Lighthouse
on: push
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Run Lighthouse on urls with lighthouserc
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
        with:
          urls: 'https://example.com/'
          configPath: './lighthouserc.json'
```

Chrome flags can be set directly in the `lighthouserc`'s `collect` section.

#### lighthouserc.json

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "numberOfRuns": 1,
      "settings": {
        "chromeFlags": ["--disable-gpu", "--no-sandbox", "--no-zygote"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Custom Lighthouse config can be defined in a seperate Lighthouse config using
the [custom Lighthouse config syntax](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).
This is then referenced by the `lighthouserc` file in the `configPath`.

#### lighthouserc.json

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "numberOfRuns": 1,
      "settings": {
        "configPath": "./lighthouse-config.js"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then put all the custom Lighthouse config in the file referenced in the `lighthouserc`.

#### lighthouse-config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: 'lighthouse:default',
  settings: {
    emulatedFormFactor: 'desktop',
    audits: [{ path: 'metrics/first-contentful-paint', options: { scorePODR: 800, scoreMedian: 1600 } }]
  }
}
```

 <summary>Test a static site without having to deploy it.</summary><br>

Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` and identify a `lighthouserc` file with a
`staticDistDir` config.

#### main.yml

```yml
name: Lighthouse
on: push
jobs:
  static-dist-dir:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Run Lighthouse against a static dist dir
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
        with:
          configPath: './lighthouserc.json'
```

#### lighthouserc.json

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "staticDistDir": "./dist"
    }
  }
}
```

Inside your `staticDistDir` there should be html files that make up your site.
LHCI will run a simple static webserver to host the files, then run an audit
against each of them. More details on this process are in the [Lighthouse CI docs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#run-lighthouse-ci).
